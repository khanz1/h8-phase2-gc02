# News Feature Implementation

## What have been changed, fixed or added

I have implemented a complete **News Management Feature** that follows the established project patterns and provides comprehensive news article and category management capabilities. This implementation includes both authenticated management endpoints and public consumption APIs.

### Files Created:

- `src/features/news/news.types.ts` - Type definitions, validation schemas, and interfaces
- `src/features/news/news.repository.ts` - Data access layer with category and article repositories
- `src/features/news/news.service.ts` - Business logic layer with category and article services
- `src/features/news/news.controller.ts` - HTTP request handlers with proper error handling
- `src/features/news/news.routes.ts` - Route configuration with authentication and authorization

### Files Updated:

- `src/app.ts` - Added news routes registration (`/apis/news` and `/apis/pub/news`)
- `src/shared/utils/route-mapper.ts` - Added news endpoint recognition for route mapping
- `src/app.service.ts` - Added news endpoints to application info response
- `docs/postman.json` - Added comprehensive News Management section with Categories, Articles, and Public News API

## Features Implemented

### News Categories Management

- Get all categories (Auth required)
- Get category by ID with associated articles (Auth required)
- Create category (Admin only)
- Update category (Admin only)
- Delete category (Admin only, with foreign key constraint protection)

### News Articles Management

- Get all articles with category and author info (Auth required)
- Get article by ID (Auth required)
- Create article (Staff/Admin only, auto-assigns author)
- Update article (Staff/Admin with ownership or Admin override)
- Update article image via Cloudinary upload (Staff/Admin with ownership)
- Delete article (Staff/Admin with ownership or Admin override)

### Public News API

- Get paginated articles with search and filter capabilities
- Get public article by ID
- Get public categories list
- Standard query parameters: `q` (search titles), `i` (filter by category names), `limit`, `page`, `sort`

### Security & Authorization

- **Admin**: Full access to categories and articles
- **Staff**: Can manage own articles, view all content
- **User**: Can view authenticated content only
- **Public**: Can access public consumption endpoints without authentication

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Consistent Architecture**: Follows established patterns from blog, career, and movie features
- **Role-Based Security**: Proper authorization with ownership checks and admin overrides
- **Standard Query Pattern**: Uses established `q`, `i`, `limit`, `page`, `sort` parameters
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions and Zod validation
- **Error Handling**: Strategic database constraint error handling with custom messages
- **File Upload**: Cloudinary integration for article image management
- **Public API**: No-auth endpoints for content consumption
- **Postman Integration**: Complete API documentation with real-world examples

### Cons

- **Additional Complexity**: Adds another feature module to maintain
- **Storage Overhead**: News images consume Cloudinary storage quota
- **Database Load**: Additional tables and relationships increase query complexity

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Model Architecture**: Uses existing `NewsCategory` and `NewsArticle` models from `news.model.ts`
- **Query Optimization**: Proper indexing on foreign keys, timestamps, and search fields
- **Memory Pattern**: Follows established repository-service-controller pattern [[memory:1028511]]
- **Error Strategy**: Removes redundant try-catch blocks, keeps only DB constraint handlers [[memory:1028511]]
- **Naming Convention**: Uses clean class names without "Impl" suffix, "I" prefix for interfaces [[memory:1028511]]

## Postman Collection Updates

Added **News Management** section with three subfolders:

- **Categories**: 5 endpoints for category CRUD operations
- **Articles**: 6 endpoints for article management including image upload
- **Public News API**: 3 endpoints for public content consumption

Examples include:

- Realistic AI/technology news content
- Category filtering by "technology,politics"
- Article search by "AI" keyword
- Professional image URLs from Unsplash

## No Known Bugs

The implementation follows established patterns and has been thoroughly designed to maintain consistency with existing features. All error scenarios are properly handled with appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive messages.
