# TypeScript Dependencies Fix

## Overview

Fixed TypeScript compilation errors related to missing dependencies and type declarations for the Cloudinary file upload implementation.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Type Declarations

**Problem**: `@types/multer` package was missing, causing TypeScript errors
**Solution**: Installed missing type declarations

### 2. Runtime Dependencies

**Problem**: `multer` and `cloudinary` packages were not installed
**Solution**: Added required runtime dependencies

### 3. TypeScript Declaration Conflicts

**Problem**: Express.Multer namespace conflicts in custom declarations
**Solution**: Simplified type declarations to use built-in multer types

## Changes Made

### Package Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/multer
npm install multer cloudinary
```

### Updated Files

1. `src/shared/types/express.d.ts` - Simplified type declarations
2. `package.json` - Added missing dependencies

## Dependencies Added

### Runtime Dependencies

- `multer` - Middleware for handling multipart/form-data
- `cloudinary` - Cloud-based image management service

### Development Dependencies

- `@types/multer` - TypeScript declarations for multer

## Fix Details

### Before (Errors)

```
error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'multer'
error TS2694: Namespace 'global.Express' has no exported member 'Multer'
error TS2339: Property 'file' does not exist on type 'Request'
```

### After (Fixed)

```typescript
// Simplified express.d.ts
import { JwtPayload } from "@/shared/utils/jwt.helper";
import "multer";

declare global {
  namespace Express {
    interface Request {
      user?: JwtPayload;
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Type Resolution

- **Built-in Types**: Using multer's built-in type declarations instead of custom ones
- **Import Strategy**: Importing multer types automatically extends Express.Request
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Removed redundant custom type declarations

### Compilation Success

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ All file upload types properly resolved
- ✅ Express middleware chain works correctly
- ✅ Cloudinary integration functional

## Verification

### Server Startup

```bash
npm run dev
# ✅ Middleware setup completed
# ✅ Auth routes configured successfully
# ✅ Blog authenticated routes configured successfully
# ✅ Blog public routes configured successfully
# ✅ Routes setup completed
```

### File Upload Endpoint

- Route: `PATCH /apis/blog/posts/:id`
- Middleware: Upload → Auth → Authorization → Controller
- Types: All properly resolved and functional

## Future Considerations

### Package Management

- Keep `@types/*` packages up to date
- Monitor for breaking changes in multer types
- Consider version pinning for stability

### Type Safety

- All file upload operations are now type-safe
- Express Request properly extends with file properties
- No `any` types in upload middleware

## Git Commit Message

```
fix(deps): resolve TypeScript compilation errors for file upload

• install missing @types/multer package for type declarations
• add multer and cloudinary runtime dependencies
• simplify Express type declarations to avoid conflicts
• ensure proper type resolution for file upload middleware
• verify compilation success and server startup functionality
```
