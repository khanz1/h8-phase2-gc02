# 13 - User Model Restoration

## Overview

Restored the proper User model with all required fields from the migration schema to the users folder, replacing the simplified auth-only version that was incorrectly created.

## Files Created

- `src/features/users/user.model.ts` - Complete User model matching migration schema
- `src/features/users/user.types.ts` - User-related TypeScript interfaces

## Files Updated

- `src/features/auth/auth.types.ts` - Updated RegisterRequest to include all user fields
- `src/features/auth/auth.repository.ts` - Updated to use proper User model
- `src/features/auth/auth.service.ts` - Updated to work with complete User model
- `src/database/models/index.ts` - Updated export to use users folder model

## Files Deleted

- `src/features/auth/auth.model.ts` - Removed simplified version

## Implementation Details

### User Model Features

- **ID**: Integer primary key with auto-increment (matching migration)
- **Username**: Required string field with uniqueness constraint
- **Email**: Required email field with validation
- **Password**: Required field with bcrypt hashing
- **Role**: Enum field with Admin/Staff/User options, defaults to Staff
- **Phone Number**: Optional phone number field
- **Address**: Optional text field for address
- **Timestamps**: Created/updated timestamps with underscored naming

### Model Validation

- Username length validation (3-50 characters)
- Email format validation
- Role validation with allowed values
- Password hashing on create/update operations

### Auth Integration

- Updated RegisterRequest to include all user fields
- Modified auth service and repository to handle complete user data
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing auth endpoints
- Updated JWT payload to use integer user IDs

### Field Mapping

- Database fields use snake_case naming (phone_number, created_at)
- Model properties use camelCase naming (phoneNumber, createdAt)
- Proper field mapping with Sequelize field attributes

## Architecture Compliance

- Restored feature-based organization (users vs auth separation)
- Maintained service-repository pattern
- Preserved OOP principles and validation
- Compatible with existing migration schema
