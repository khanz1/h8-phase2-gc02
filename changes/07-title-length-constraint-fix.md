# 07 - Title Length Constraint Fix

## Overview

Fixed database schema constraints to accommodate longer titles in the seed data, resolved missing content fields, and successfully completed the database seeding process.

## Files Modified

### Database Schema:

- `scripts/migrations.sql` - Updated title length limits and constraints

### Sequelize Models:

- `src/features/blog/blog.model.ts` - Updated title validation
- `src/features/news/news.model.ts` - Updated title validation
- `src/features/movies/movie.model.ts` - Updated title validation
- `src/features/careers/career.model.ts` - Updated title validation

### Seed Data:

- `data/blog/posts.json` - Fixed missing content field and adjusted constraints

## Technical Implementation

### Issue Resolution

1. **Title Length Issue**: Found a blog post title with 256 characters exceeding the 255 VARCHAR limit
2. **Missing Content**: Identified a blog post without content field causing null constraint violation
3. **Minimum Length**: Found titles shorter than 5 characters violating minimum length constraints

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- Updated title lengths from VARCHAR(255) to VARCHAR(500)
"title" VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL

-- Adjusted minimum length constraints from 5 to 2 characters
CONSTRAINT "Blog_Posts_title_length_check" CHECK (LENGTH("title") >= 2)
```

### Model Validation Updates

```typescript
title: {
  type: DataTypes.STRING(500),
  allowNull: false,
  validate: {
    len: {
      args: [2, 500],
      msg: "Title must be between 2 and 500 characters",
    },
  },
}
```

### Data Quality Fixes

- Added missing content to "Node FINALLY Supports TypeScript" blog post
- Ensured all posts have required content field with meaningful text

## Affected Tables

- `Blog_Posts` - Title length increased to 500 characters
- `News_Articles` - Title length increased to 500 characters
- `Movie_Movies` - Title length increased to 500 characters
- `Career_Jobs` - Title length increased to 500 characters

## Testing Results

✅ Migration rollback and apply successful
✅ Database seeding completed without errors
✅ All 168 blog posts seeded successfully
✅ Users, categories, and all other modules seeded properly

## Git Commit Message

```
fix(database): increase title length limits and fix seed data

- Update VARCHAR(255) to VARCHAR(500) for title fields
- Reduce minimum title length from 5 to 2 characters
- Fix missing content in blog post seed data
- Update Sequelize model validations to match schema
- Ensure successful database seeding with all constraints

BREAKING CHANGE: database schema updated with new title length limits
```

## Performance Impact

- Minimal impact as VARCHAR storage is optimized in PostgreSQL
- Increased flexibility for content with longer titles
- Better accommodation of real-world content requirements

## Validation

- All existing constraints maintained
- Data integrity preserved
- Seeding process now completes successfully
- Ready for application development and testing
