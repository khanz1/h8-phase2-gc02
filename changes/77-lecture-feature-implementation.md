# 77 - Lecture Feature Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a complete lecture management system with Anime model following the established product feature pattern. This feature provides comprehensive CRUD operations for anime movies with both authenticated management and public browsing capabilities.

## Changes Made

### Files Created

#### 1. Core Feature Files

- **src/features/lecture/lecture.types.ts** - Type definitions, validation schemas, DTOs, and interfaces
- **src/features/lecture/lecture.model.ts** - Sequelize Anime model with proper validations and associations
- **src/features/lecture/lecture.repository.ts** - Data access layer for anime operations
- **src/features/lecture/lecture.service.ts** - Business logic layer with error handling
- **src/features/lecture/lecture.controller.ts** - HTTP request handlers for anime operations
- **src/features/lecture/lecture.routes.ts** - Route definitions for authenticated and public endpoints

### Files Updated

#### 2. Application Integration

- **src/app.ts** - Added lecture routes registration for both authenticated and public endpoints
- **src/database/models/index.ts** - Added Anime model initialization and associations
- **docs/postman.json** - Added comprehensive Lecture Management section with all endpoints

## Architecture Details

### Database Schema

The Anime model includes:

- `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY) - Auto-incrementing identifier
- `title` (STRING, required) - Anime title (1-200 characters)
- `synopsis` (TEXT, required) - Detailed description (10-5000 characters)
- `coverUrl` (TEXT, optional) - Cover image URL with validation
- `authorId` (INTEGER, required) - Foreign key to Users table
- `createdAt/updatedAt` (DATE) - Automatic timestamps

### API Endpoints

#### Authenticated Endpoints (`/apis/lectures/movies`)

- **GET** `/apis/lectures/movies` - Retrieve all animes (requires authentication)
- **GET** `/apis/lectures/movies/:id` - Get specific anime by ID
- **POST** `/apis/lectures/movies` - Create new anime (Staff/Admin only)
- **PUT** `/apis/lectures/movies/:id` - Update anime (Staff/Admin + ownership)
- **PATCH** `/apis/lectures/movies/:id` - Update cover image (Staff/Admin + ownership)
- **DELETE** `/apis/lectures/movies/:id` - Delete anime (Staff/Admin + ownership)

#### Public Endpoints (`/apis/pub/lectures/movies`)

- **GET** `/apis/pub/lectures/movies` - Paginated anime list with search (no auth required)
- **GET** `/apis/pub/lectures/movies/:id` - Get anime details (no auth required)

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Validation & Security

- Comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all inputs
- Input sanitization and type checking
- Author-based ownership validation
- Role-based access control (Admin, Staff permissions)

#### 2. Search & Pagination

- Title-based search functionality using ILIKE for case-insensitive matching
- Configurable pagination (4-12 items per page)
- Sorting options (ASC/DESC by creation date)
- Comprehensive pagination metadata

#### 3. Image Management

- Cloudinary integration for cover image uploads
- Automatic image optimization and transformation
- Support for JPEG, PNG, WebP formats
- Organized storage in 'animes' folder

#### 4. Error Handling

- Clean error handling without unnecessary try-catch blocks
- Consistent error responses using ResponseDto
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for validation failures

## Technical Implementation

### Code Quality Standards

- **Clean Architecture**: Service-Repository pattern with clear separation of concerns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict typing
- **Memory Management**: Follows established memory patterns for error handling
- **Naming Conventions**: Clean class names without "Impl" suffix, interfaces with "I" prefix
- **Consistent Patterns**: Mirrors existing feature implementations (products, movies, etc.)

### Database Integration

- Proper Sequelize model with validation constraints
- Foreign key relationships with CASCADE operations
- Indexed fields for performance optimization
- Association with User model for author tracking

### Postman Collection Updates

- **Lecture Management** section with comprehensive endpoint documentation
- **Animes** subsection for authenticated operations
- **Public Lecture API** subsection for public access
- Detailed descriptions, examples, and parameter documentation
- Consistent authentication patterns using bearer tokens

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Consistency**: Follows established patterns from other features
- **Completeness**: Full CRUD operations with proper validation
- **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **Public Access**: Dedicated public endpoints for content consumption
- **Image Support**: Integrated image upload and management
- **Search & Pagination**: Comprehensive query capabilities
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Documentation**: Complete Postman collection integration

### Cons

- **Single Model**: Unlike other features, only has one model (Anime) without categories
- **Complex Routes**: Dual endpoint structure (authenticated + public) increases complexity
- **Image Dependencies**: Requires Cloudinary configuration for full functionality
