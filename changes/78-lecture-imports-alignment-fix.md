# Lecture Feature Import Patterns Alignment

## Changes Made

Fixed import patterns and usage in the lecture feature to align with the products feature implementation for consistency across the codebase.

### Files Modified

1. **src/features/lecture/lecture.routes.ts**

   - Updated imports to use class-based patterns
   - Changed from function imports to class static method imports
   - Added ownership middleware for better authorization

2. **src/features/lecture/lecture.controller.ts**
   - Fixed ResponseDTO import and usage pattern
   - Updated CloudinaryHelper import and method usage
   - Standardized error handling with BadRequestError
   - Improved parameter parsing with parseInt radix
   - Enhanced response structure for image uploads

### Import Pattern Changes

#### Before (Outdated Pattern)

```typescript
import { routeWrapper } from "@/shared/utils/route-wrapper";
import { authMiddleware } from "@/shared/middleware/auth.middleware";
import { authorizationMiddleware } from "@/shared/middleware/authorization.middleware";
import { uploadMiddleware } from "@/shared/middleware/upload.middleware";
import { ResponseDto } from "@/shared/utils/response.dto";
import { uploadToCloudinary } from "@/shared/utils/cloudinary.helper";
```

#### After (Consistent Pattern)

```typescript
import { RouteWrapper } from "@/shared/utils/route-wrapper";
import { AuthMiddleware } from "@/shared/middleware/auth.middleware";
import { AuthorizationMiddleware } from "@/shared/middleware/authorization.middleware";
import { UploadMiddleware } from "@/shared/middleware/upload.middleware";
import { ResponseDTO } from "@/shared/utils/response.dto";
import { CloudinaryHelper } from "@/shared/utils/cloudinary.helper";
```

### Route Configuration Updates

#### Before

```typescript
routeWrapper(this.animeController.getAllAnimes);
authMiddleware;
authorizationMiddleware(["Admin", "Staff"]);
uploadMiddleware.single("file");
```

#### After

```typescript
RouteWrapper.withErrorHandler(this.animeController.getAllAnimes);
AuthMiddleware.authenticate;
AuthorizationMiddleware.requireAdminOrStaff;
AuthorizationMiddleware.requireOwnership(Anime);
UploadMiddleware.singleImage("file");
```

### Controller Improvements

1. **Response Handling**

   - Standardized to use `ResponseDTO.success()` and `ResponseDTO.successPaginated()`
   - Consistent parameter order (message first, data second)

2. **Error Handling**

   - Replaced manual error responses with `BadRequestError` throws
   - Removed try-catch blocks that just re-throw errors

3. **Image Upload**

   - Updated to use `CloudinaryHelper.uploadImage()` method
   - Enhanced response with upload metadata information

4. **Authorization**
   - Added ownership checks for update/delete operations
   - Improved middleware chain organization

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Consistency**: All features now follow the same import and usage patterns
- **Type Safety**: Class-based imports provide better TypeScript support
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain with standardized patterns
- **Security**: Added ownership checks for resource protection
- **Error Handling**: Cleaner error handling with proper error classes

### Cons

- **Migration Effort**: Required updating existing code patterns
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to be aware of the new patterns

## No Remaining Issues

All linter errors for the lecture feature have been resolved. The feature now follows the same patterns as the products feature for consistency across the codebase.
