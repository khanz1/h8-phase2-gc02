# BaseModel Serialization Fix

## Overview

Fixed missing `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields in API responses by adding a proper `toJSON()` method to the `BaseModel` class. This ensures all models extending `BaseModel` properly serialize these base attributes in JSON responses.

## Problem Identified

### Missing Base Attributes in API Responses

**Issue**: API responses were missing base model attributes (`id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`)
**Example of problematic response**:

```json
{
  "title": "Xterm.js",
  "content": "Xterm.js allows building browser-based terminals...",
  "imgUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  "categoryId": 8,
  "authorId": 8,
  "category": {
    "name": "Cloud Computing"
  },
  "author": {
    "id": 8,
    "username": "manager1",
    "email": "manager1@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Root Cause**:

- Models extending `BaseModel` didn't have explicit `toJSON()` method
- While base attributes were declared and initialized, they weren't being serialized
- User model worked correctly because it had its own `toJSON()` implementation

## Solution Applied

### Added toJSON Method to BaseModel

**File**: `src/database/models/BaseModel.ts`

```typescript
/**
 * Ensure base attributes are included in JSON serialization
 */
public toJSON(): any {
  const values = { ...this.get() };
  return values;
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Consistent Serialization**: All models extending BaseModel now serialize consistently
2. **Complete API Responses**: All base attributes are included in responses
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Doesn't break existing functionality
4. **Future-Proof**: Any new models extending BaseModel will automatically include base attributes

## Expected API Response After Fix

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Xterm.js",
  "content": "Xterm.js allows building browser-based terminals...",
  "imgUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  "categoryId": 8,
  "authorId": 8,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "category": {
    "id": 8,
    "name": "Cloud Computing"
  },
  "author": {
    "id": 8,
    "username": "manager1",
    "email": "manager1@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Models Affected

All models extending `BaseModel`:

- `BlogCategory` & `BlogPost`
- `BrandedCategory` & `BrandedProduct`
- `MovieGenre` & `Movie`
- `NewsCategory` & `NewsArticle`
- `CareerCompany` & `CareerJob`
- `RestaurantCategory` & `RestaurantCuisine`
- `RoomType` & `RoomLodging`
- `RentalType` & `RentalTransportation`

## Technical Details

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Sequelize Model.get()**: Returns all model attributes including base ones
2. **Spread Operator**: Ensures all properties are included in the returned object
3. **toJSON Override**: Sequelize automatically calls this method during JSON serialization
4. **BaseModel Inheritance**: All extending models inherit this behavior

### Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Individual toJSON per model**: Too much duplication
2. **Repository-level serialization**: Already implemented but wasn't sufficient
3. **Custom serializer**: Overkill for this simple fix

## Testing Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ All models now include base attributes in responses
