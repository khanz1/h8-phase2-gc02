# Blog Implementation Alignment with Auth Patterns

## Overview

Refactored the blog feature implementation to align with existing authentication patterns and added proper ownership-based access controls as requested by project requirements.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Router Pattern Inconsistency

**Problem**: Blog routes used functional approach while auth routes used class-based approach
**Solution**: Refactored to class-based `BlogRoutes` class matching `AuthRoutes` pattern

**Before:**

```typescript
// Functional approach
const blogRouter = Router();
blogRouter.get("/posts", authMiddleware, controller.getAllPosts);
export { blogRouter };
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Class-based approach matching auth pattern
export class BlogRoutes {
  private readonly router: Router;
  constructor() {
    // Dependency injection
    this.setupAuthenticatedRoutes();
  }
  public getRouter(): Router {
    return this.router;
  }
}
```

### 2. Missing Ownership Checks

**Problem**: No validation to ensure users can only modify their own blog posts
**Solution**: Added ownership validation by fetching data first, then comparing authorId

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Get the existing post to check ownership
const existingPost = await this.postService.getPostById(id);

// Check ownership - only author or admin can update
if (existingPost.authorId !== currentUserId && currentUserRole !== "Admin") {
  throw new ForbiddenError("You can only update your own blog posts");
}
```

### 3. Logger Pattern Inconsistency

**Problem**: Blog controllers used direct `logger` import while auth used `Logger.getInstance()`
**Solution**: Updated to use singleton pattern matching auth implementation

**Before:**

```typescript
import { logger } from "@/config/logger";
logger.info("message");
```

**After:**

```typescript
import { Logger } from "@/config/logger";
private readonly logger = Logger.getInstance();
this.logger.info("message");
```

### 4. Sequelize Type Issues

**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors with Sequelize model creation
**Solution**: Added proper type casting for model creation operations

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/features/blog/blog.controller.ts`

- Added Logger singleton pattern
- Implemented ownership checks for update/delete operations
- Added `ForbiddenError` handling
- Updated all logger calls to use instance method

### 2. `src/features/blog/blog.routes.ts`

- Converted from functional to class-based approach
- Added dependency injection through constructor
- Separated authenticated and public route setup methods
- Added logging for route configuration confirmation

### 3. `src/features/blog/blog.repository.ts`

- Fixed Sequelize type casting issues
- Ensured compatibility with model creation operations

### 4. `src/app.ts`

- Updated to use new class-based BlogRoutes
- Maintains consistency with AuthRoutes registration pattern

### 5. `changes/16-blog-feature-implementation.md`

- Updated documentation to reflect new patterns
- Added ownership control documentation
- Included security implementation details

## Key Improvements

### Ownership-Based Security

- **Data-First Approach**: Always fetch existing data before modifications
- **Author Verification**: Compare `authorId` from database with `userId` from JWT
- **Admin Override**: Admins can modify any content regardless of ownership
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Use `ForbiddenError` for unauthorized access

### Architecture Consistency

- **Class-Based Patterns**: All route classes follow same structure
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based dependency management
- **Logger Singleton**: Consistent logging pattern across features
- **OOP Principles**: Proper encapsulation and separation of concerns

### Authorization Hierarchy

1. **Public**: Read-only access to published content
2. **Authenticated**: Read access to all content
3. **Staff**: Create content, modify own content
4. **Admin**: Full access including delete operations

## Security Enhancement

### Before (Insufficient):

```typescript
// Only role-based check
blogRouter.put("/posts/:id", authMiddleware, requireStaff, updatePost);
```

### After (Ownership + Role):

```typescript
// Role check + ownership validation
async updatePost(req, res) {
  const existingPost = await this.postService.getPostById(id);
  if (existingPost.authorId !== currentUserId && currentUserRole !== 'Admin') {
    throw new ForbiddenError("You can only update your own blog posts");
  }
  // Proceed with update...
}
```

## Project Rules Compliance

✅ **Use classes for services, repositories, and controllers**
✅ **Implement dependency injection through constructors**
✅ **Use private/protected/public access modifiers appropriately**
✅ **Follow single responsibility principle**
✅ **Use composition over inheritance where possible**
✅ **Add comments for complex business logic**
✅ **Group imports logically (external, internal, types)**

## Testing Recommendations

### Ownership Tests

- Test that users can only modify their own posts
- Test that admins can modify any posts
- Test that staff cannot modify posts from other staff members
- Test proper error responses for unauthorized access

### Integration Tests

- Verify end-to-end ownership validation
- Test role-based access control combinations
- Validate error handling and response formats
