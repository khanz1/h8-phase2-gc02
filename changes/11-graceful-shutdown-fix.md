# Graceful Shutdown Fix

## Problem

The application was keeping the port open even when pressing Ctrl+C or when terminal sessions were killed, preventing proper server shutdown.

## Root Cause

- The HTTP server instance wasn't being properly stored and closed during shutdown
- Database connections weren't being force-closed if graceful shutdown failed
- Missing proper timeout handling for shutdown operations
- Process wasn't explicitly exiting after cleanup

## Solution

### Files Updated

1. **src/server.ts** - Enhanced server shutdown process
2. **src/config/database.ts** - Improved database connection cleanup

### Technical Implementation

#### Server Shutdown Improvements

- Added proper HTTP server instance storage
- Implemented graceful shutdown with 10-second timeout
- Added shutdown state tracking to prevent multiple shutdown attempts
- Added explicit `process.exit(0)` calls after cleanup
- Enhanced signal handling for SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGHUP

#### Database Connection Cleanup

- Added 5-second timeout for database connection closure
- Implemented force close mechanism using `connectionManager.close()`
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### Key Changes

- HTTP server now properly closes listening socket
- Database connections are force-closed if graceful shutdown fails
- Added timeout protection for both server and database shutdown
- Process explicitly exits after successful cleanup
- Better logging for shutdown process debugging

### Usage

The application now properly shuts down when:

- Pressing Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
- Receiving SIGTERM signal
- Receiving SIGHUP signal
- Terminal session is killed

Port will be immediately released and available for reuse after shutdown.
