- Enhanced request bodies with real-world blog content examples
- Added detailed parameter descriptions for all variables
- Improved image upload documentation with supported formats

### Public API Section

- Enhanced query parameter documentation for pagination
- Added realistic search examples (React, Vue, technology categories)
- Improved descriptions explaining public access requirements
- Better documentation for filtering and sorting options

### Variables and Configuration

- Updated base URLs to match project configuration (localhost:8002)
- Enhanced variable descriptions for better clarity
- Added automatic token management through test scripts
- Improved email examples with professional domain names

### Documentation Enhancements

- Added comprehensive descriptions for all endpoints
- Included permission requirements and authentication details
- Enhanced parameter descriptions with validation rules
- Added real-world example data throughout

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Better Developer Experience**: Clear, comprehensive documentation makes API testing easier
- **Real-world Examples**: Realistic data helps developers understand expected input/output
- **Professional Presentation**: Well-organized structure reflects project quality
- **Automatic Token Management**: Test scripts reduce manual token copying
- **Complete Coverage**: All auth and blog features are documented
- **Clear Permission Model**: Developers understand role-based access requirements
- **Enhanced Searchability**: Better names and descriptions improve navigation

### Cons

- **Larger File Size**: More detailed documentation increases file size
- **Maintenance Overhead**: More comprehensive documentation requires updates when API changes
- **Learning Curve**: New team members need time to understand the full structure

## Remaining Tasks

All major functionality is now documented. Future considerations:

- Update collection when new API endpoints are added
- Add response examples for better understanding
- Consider adding environment-specific variable sets
- Add automated tests for critical workflows

## Technical Details

### File Updated

- `docs/postman.json` - Complete restructuring and enhancement of API collection

### Key Improvements

- Organized hierarchical folder structure for better navigation
- Enhanced all request examples with realistic, domain-relevant data
- Added comprehensive parameter validation documentation
- Implemented automatic token management for seamless testing workflow
- Updated all endpoint descriptions with clear authentication and permission requirements

### Authentication Flow

- Login endpoint now automatically saves JWT token to environment variables
- All protected endpoints reference the saved token for seamless testing
- Clear role-based permission documentation for each endpoint

### Real-world Examples

- Blog posts about modern web development topics (React vs Vue)
- Professional user profiles with realistic contact information
- Technology-focused categories (Machine Learning, AI, etc.)
- Proper image URLs from professional stock photo services
