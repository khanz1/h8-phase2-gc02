# Method Binding Context Fix

## Changes Summary

### What Changed

Fixed a critical JavaScript context binding issue that was causing `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'logger')` error when accessing the seed API endpoint.

### Files Modified

#### Core Application

- **src/app.ts**:
  - Fixed method binding for `/apis/seed` route by adding `.bind(this.appService)`
  - Updated `/health` and `/` routes to use RouteWrapper pattern for consistency
  - Ensured all AppService methods maintain proper context when passed as callbacks

## What Was Changed, Fixed, or Added

### JavaScript Context Binding Issue

The error occurred because when methods are passed as callbacks to `RouteWrapper.withErrorHandler`, they lose their original `this` context. This is a fundamental JavaScript behavior where method references don't carry their instance context.

**Root Cause**:

```typescript
// BROKEN - loses context
this.app.get(
  "/apis/seed",
  RouteWrapper.withErrorHandler(this.appService.handleSeedRequest)
);

// When called later: this.logger becomes undefined
```

**Solution**:

```typescript
// FIXED - maintains context
this.app.get(
  "/apis/seed",
  RouteWrapper.withErrorHandler(
    this.appService.handleSeedRequest.bind(this.appService)
  )
);

// Now this.logger properly refers to the instance
```

### Route Handler Consistency

Updated all AppService route handlers to use the same pattern:

1. **Health Check Route**:

   - Changed from arrow function wrapper to RouteWrapper pattern
   - Added proper binding for consistent error handling

2. **App Info Route**:

   - Changed from arrow function wrapper to RouteWrapper pattern
   - Added proper binding for consistent error handling

3. **Seed Route**:
   - Fixed context binding issue
   - Maintained RouteWrapper error handling

### Error Handling Improvements

- **Consistent Error Handling**: All routes now use RouteWrapper for standardized error processing
- **Proper Context Preservation**: Methods maintain access to their class properties (`this.logger`, `this.seedService`)
- **Better Error Reporting**: RouteWrapper can now properly catch and handle errors from all AppService methods

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Fixed Critical Bug**: Resolved the `undefined logger` error that was breaking the seed API
- **Consistent Pattern**: All AppService routes now follow the same error handling pattern
- **Better Error Handling**: RouteWrapper provides centralized error management for all routes
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear, consistent approach to method binding across the application
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript method binding maintains type checking

### Cons

- **Slightly Verbose**: `.bind(this.appService)` adds some verbosity to route definitions
- **Memory Usage**: Each bound method creates a new function reference (minimal impact)
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand JavaScript context binding rules

## Remaining Issues

None. The fix addresses the immediate error and improves overall code consistency.

## Technical Implementation Details

### JavaScript Context Binding

JavaScript methods lose their `this` context when passed as function references. The `.bind()` method creates a new function with a permanently bound context.

### RouteWrapper Integration

RouteWrapper calls handlers as `await handler(req, res, next)`, which requires proper context binding for class methods to access their instance properties.

### Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Arrow Function Wrappers**: Would work but less consistent with other route patterns
2. **Constructor Binding**: Could bind in constructor but makes code less explicit
3. **Class Property Arrow Functions**: Would work but changes method definition style

The chosen solution (explicit binding) provides the best balance of clarity and consistency.

**Git Commit Message:**

```
fix(app): resolve method context binding issue in route handlers

• fix undefined logger error in seed API endpoint
• add proper .bind() context for AppService methods in routes
• standardize all AppService routes to use RouteWrapper pattern
• ensure consistent error handling across health, info, and seed endpoints
• prevent future context-related runtime errors

Fixes critical bug where this.logger was undefined when methods were
passed as callbacks to RouteWrapper.withErrorHandler without proper
context binding.
