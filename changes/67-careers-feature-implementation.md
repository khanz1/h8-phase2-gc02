# Careers Feature Implementation

## Changes Made

Implemented a complete careers management feature following the same architectural patterns as the blog feature, including company and job posting management with full CRUD operations and public API endpoints.

### Files Created

**Core Feature Files:**

- `src/features/careers/career.types.ts` - TypeScript types, validation schemas, and interfaces
- `src/features/careers/career.repository.ts` - Data access layer with company and job repositories
- `src/features/careers/career.service.ts` - Business logic layer for companies and jobs
- `src/features/careers/career.controller.ts` - HTTP request handlers for all endpoints
- `src/features/careers/career.routes.ts` - Route configuration with authentication and authorization

**Integration Updates:**

- Updated `src/app.ts` to register careers routes
- Updated `src/shared/utils/route-mapper.ts` to recognize careers route patterns
- Updated `docs/postman.json` with comprehensive careers API documentation

### Feature Architecture

**Company Management:**

- Full CRUD operations for career companies
- Admin-only access for company management
- Unique constraints on company name and email
- Company logo, location, description fields
- Associated job postings relationship

**Job Management:**

- Full CRUD operations for job postings
- Staff/Admin can create, update, delete jobs
- Ownership-based access control for job modifications
- Job types: Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Internship, Remote
- Image upload functionality with Cloudinary integration
- Rich job descriptions with requirements and benefits

**Public API:**

- Paginated job listings with search and filtering
- Search by job title (q parameter)
- Filter by job types (i parameter)
- Filter by company locations (l parameter)
- Public access to company profiles
- No authentication required for public endpoints

### API Endpoints

**Protected Company Routes (`/apis/careers/companies`):**

- `GET /` - List all companies (authenticated)
- `GET /:id` - Get company details with job listings (authenticated)
- `POST /` - Create company (Admin only)
- `PUT /:id` - Update company (Admin only)
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete company (Admin only)

**Protected Job Routes (`/apis/careers/jobs`):**

- `GET /` - List all jobs (authenticated)
- `GET /:id` - Get job details (authenticated)
- `POST /` - Create job (Staff/Admin)
- `PUT /:id` - Update job (Staff/Admin + ownership)
- `PATCH /:id` - Update job image (Staff/Admin + ownership)
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete job (Staff/Admin + ownership)

**Public Routes (`/apis/pub/careers`):**

- `GET /jobs` - Paginated job listings with filtering
- `GET /jobs/:id` - Public job details
- `GET /companies` - Public company listings

### Postman Collection Updates

Added comprehensive careers API documentation following the established organizational pattern:

**Career Management Section:**

- **Companies** subfolder with all company management endpoints
- **Jobs** subfolder with all job management endpoints
- **Public Career API** subfolder with public endpoints

**Real-world Examples:**

- TechCorp Solutions company profile with detailed description
- Senior Full-Stack Developer job posting with comprehensive requirements
- Professional image URLs from Unsplash
- Realistic filtering examples (developer, Full-time/Remote, San Francisco/New York)

**Documentation Features:**

- Detailed endpoint descriptions with permission requirements
- Comprehensive parameter documentation
- Real-world request/response examples
- Proper Content-Type headers and authentication setup

### Database Integration

**Models Used:**

- Leveraged existing `CareerCompany` and `CareerJob` models from `career.model.ts`
- Proper associations: Company hasMany Jobs, Job belongsTo Company and User
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (company_id, author_id, job_type)

**Validation:**

- Company names and emails must be unique
- Job descriptions minimum 50 characters
- Job titles 3-500 characters range
- Valid job type enum enforcement
- Email format validation for companies

### Security & Authorization

**Role-Based Access Control:**

- **Admin**: Full access to all company and job operations
- **Staff**: Can manage jobs they created, view all companies
- **User**: Can only view through authenticated endpoints
- **Public**: Access to public job listings and company profiles

**Ownership Control:**

- Job creators can modify their own jobs
- Admins can override ownership restrictions
- Proper authorization middleware integration

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Consistent Architecture**: Follows exact patterns established by blog feature
- **Comprehensive Features**: Complete job board functionality with companies and jobs
- **Advanced Filtering**: Public API supports multiple filter combinations
- **Rich Content**: Detailed job descriptions with formatted requirements/benefits
- **Professional Examples**: Real-world job postings and company profiles
- **Scalable Design**: Repository pattern allows easy extension
- **Security First**: Proper role-based access control and ownership validation
- **Image Support**: Cloudinary integration for job posting images

### Cons

- **Code Duplication**: Similar patterns to blog feature (expected for consistency)
- **Complex Permissions**: Multiple authorization layers may be confusing
- **Large Payload**: Detailed job descriptions create larger API responses
- **Maintenance Overhead**: More endpoints to maintain and document

## Technical Implementation Details

### Query Optimization

- Includes proper associations in repository queries
- Indexes on foreign keys and frequently filtered fields
- Efficient pagination with offset/limit patterns
- Selective field loading for public API responses

### Error Handling

- Consistent error patterns across all operations
- Proper constraint violation handling (unique conflicts)
- Foreign key constraint errors for cascading deletes
- Validation errors with detailed field messages

### Type Safety

- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all DTOs
- Zod schema validation for request data
- Strict enum types for job types
- Interface segregation for different repository operations

### Route Organization

- Clear separation between authenticated and public routes
- Middleware chains for authentication and authorization
- Proper error wrapper integration
- Consistent HTTP status codes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

- Job application submission endpoints
- Company review and rating system
- Saved jobs functionality for users
- Email notifications for new job postings
- Advanced search with salary ranges and experience levels
- Job posting expiration dates
- Application tracking system
