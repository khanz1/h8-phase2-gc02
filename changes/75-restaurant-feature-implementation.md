# Restaurant Feature Implementation

## What Changed

### Files Created

- `src/features/restaurants/restaurant.types.ts` - Type definitions, validation schemas, DTOs, and interfaces for restaurant feature
- `src/features/restaurants/restaurant.repository.ts` - Data access layer for restaurant categories and cuisines
- `src/features/restaurants/restaurant.service.ts` - Business logic layer for restaurant operations
- `src/features/restaurants/restaurant.controller.ts` - HTTP request handlers for restaurant endpoints
- `src/features/restaurants/restaurant.routes.ts` - Route definitions for authenticated and public restaurant endpoints

### Files Updated

- `docs/postman.json` - Added comprehensive Restaurant Management section with all CRUD operations and public APIs

## Implementation Details

### Feature Architecture

Implemented complete restaurant management feature following the exact same pattern as the products feature:

**Restaurant Categories:**

- CRUD operations for restaurant categories (Italian, Chinese, Mexican, etc.)
- Admin-only access for category management
- Unique name validation and foreign key constraints

**Restaurant Cuisines:**

- CRUD operations for individual cuisine dishes
- Staff/Admin creation with ownership validation
- Image upload support via Cloudinary
- Search and pagination for public consumption
- Category association and author tracking

**Public APIs:**

- Paginated cuisine listing with search and category filtering
- Public category listing for filter options
- Individual cuisine details without authentication

### Technical Implementation

- **Types**: Complete Zod validation schemas for all request/response data
- **Repository**: Full data access layer with Sequelize ORM integration
- **Service**: Business logic with error handling and validation
- **Controller**: HTTP handlers with proper logging and response formatting
- **Routes**: Authenticated and public endpoints with middleware integration

### API Endpoints Added

**Authenticated (requires token):**

- `GET /apis/restaurants/categories` - List all categories
- `GET /apis/restaurants/categories/:id` - Get category by ID
- `POST /apis/restaurants/categories` - Create category (Admin only)
- `PUT /apis/restaurants/categories/:id` - Update category (Admin only)
- `DELETE /apis/restaurants/categories/:id` - Delete category (Admin only)
- `GET /apis/restaurants/cuisines` - List all cuisines
- `GET /apis/restaurants/cuisines/:id` - Get cuisine by ID
- `POST /apis/restaurants/cuisines` - Create cuisine (Staff/Admin)
- `PUT /apis/restaurants/cuisines/:id` - Update cuisine (Owner/Admin)
- `PATCH /apis/restaurants/cuisines/:id` - Update cuisine image (Owner/Admin)
- `DELETE /apis/restaurants/cuisines/:id` - Delete cuisine (Owner/Admin)

**Public (no authentication):**

- `GET /apis/pub/restaurants/cuisines` - Paginated cuisine listing with search
- `GET /apis/pub/restaurants/cuisines/:id` - Get public cuisine details
- `GET /apis/pub/restaurants/categories` - List public categories

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Consistency**: Follows exact same pattern as existing products feature
- **Complete Feature**: Full CRUD operations with proper validation and error handling
- **Security**: Proper role-based access control and ownership validation
- **Scalability**: Paginated public APIs with search and filtering
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive Postman collection for testing
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript type definitions and validation
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns (Repository, Service, Controller)

### Cons

- **Code Duplication**: Similar patterns repeated across features (acceptable for maintainability)
- **Database Queries**: Uses same query patterns which may need optimization for large datasets
- **Image Storage**: Relies on Cloudinary (external dependency)

## Potential Issues

Currently no known bugs. All implementations follow established patterns that are working correctly in other features.

## Testing Guide

1. **Setup**: Ensure database is seeded with restaurant data
2. **Authentication**: Login as Admin/Staff user to get access token
3. **Categories**: Test CRUD operations for restaurant categories
4. **Cuisines**: Test CRUD operations for cuisine dishes
5. **Public APIs**: Test pagination, search, and filtering without authentication
6. **Image Upload**: Test cuisine image upload functionality
7. **Permissions**: Verify role-based access control and ownership validation

Use the Postman collection for comprehensive API testing.
