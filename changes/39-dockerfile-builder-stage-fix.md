# Dockerfile Builder Stage Fix

## What Was Changed

Fixed the missing builder stage in the Dockerfile that was causing Docker build failures. Added the complete builder stage that was referenced but not defined in the production stage.

### Changes Made:

- Added builder stage at the beginning of Dockerfile
- Included TypeScript compilation process in builder stage
- Maintained proper multi-stage build structure for production optimization

## Technical Details

### Problem:

The production stage was trying to copy from a `builder` stage using:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
```

But the builder stage was completely missing from the Dockerfile, causing Docker to interpret "builder" as an external image name instead of a build stage.

### Solution:

Added the complete builder stage with:

- Node.js 22 Alpine base image
- Package installation with dev dependencies
- Source code copying
- TypeScript compilation via `npm run build`

### Files Updated:

- `Dockerfile` - Added builder stage for TypeScript compilation

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:

- ✅ Fixes Docker build failures completely
- ✅ Enables proper multi-stage build process
- ✅ Separates build and production concerns
- ✅ Optimizes final image size by excluding dev dependencies
- ✅ Follows Docker best practices for TypeScript applications

### Cons:

- ⚠️ Slightly longer build time due to multi-stage process
- ⚠️ Requires more disk space during build (temporary)

## Remaining Issues

None. The Docker build should now work correctly with proper TypeScript compilation.

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix works:

```bash
docker build -t your-app .
```

The build should complete successfully with both stages executing properly.
