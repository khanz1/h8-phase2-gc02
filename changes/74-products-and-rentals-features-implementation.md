# Products and Rentals Features Implementation

## What have been changed, fixed or added

I have implemented **two complete feature sets**: the **Products Management Feature** and the **Rentals Management Feature** following the established project patterns. Both features provide comprehensive CRUD operations with authentication, authorization, and public consumption APIs.

### Products Feature Implementation

**Files Created:**

- `src/features/products/product.types.ts` - Type definitions, DTOs, and validation schemas for products and categories
- `src/features/products/product.repository.ts` - Data access layer with BrandedCategory and BrandedProduct repositories
- `src/features/products/product.service.ts` - Business logic layer with comprehensive error handling
- `src/features/products/product.controller.ts` - HTTP request handlers with Cloudinary image uploads
- `src/features/products/product.routes.ts` - Route configuration with proper authentication and authorization

**Product Feature Structure:**

- **BrandedCategory** → **BrandedProduct** relationship
- **Query Pattern**: `q` (search product names), `i` (category names), `limit`, `page`, `sort`
- **Role-based Access**: Admin (categories), Staff/Admin (products), Public (consumption)
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Image upload support for products

### Rentals Feature Implementation

**Files Created:**

- `src/features/rentals/rental.types.ts` - Type definitions, DTOs, and validation schemas for types and transportations
- `src/features/rentals/rental.repository.ts` - Data access layer with RentalType and RentalTransportation repositories
- `src/features/rentals/rental.service.ts` - Business logic layer with comprehensive error handling
- `src/features/rentals/rental.controller.ts` - HTTP request handlers with Cloudinary image uploads
- `src/features/rentals/rental.routes.ts` - Route configuration with proper authentication and authorization

**Rental Feature Structure:**

- **RentalType** → **RentalTransportation** relationship
- **Query Pattern**: `q` (search transportation names), `i` (type names), `limit`, `page`, `sort`
- **Role-based Access**: Admin (types), Staff/Admin (transportations), Public (consumption)
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Image upload support for transportations

### Integration Updates

**Updated Files:**

- `src/app.ts` - Added `/apis/products`, `/apis/pub/products`, `/apis/rentals`, `/apis/pub/rentals` routes
- `src/shared/utils/route-mapper.ts` - Added route mapping and authentication detection for new features
- `src/app.service.ts` - Added endpoint information for products and rentals APIs

### API Endpoints Created

**Products Management:**

- `GET /apis/products/categories` - List all product categories (Auth)
- `POST /apis/products/categories` - Create category (Admin only)
- `PUT /apis/products/categories/:id` - Update category (Admin only)
- `DELETE /apis/products/categories/:id` - Delete category (Admin only)
- `GET /apis/products/products` - List all products (Auth)
- `POST /apis/products/products` - Create product (Staff/Admin)
- `PUT /apis/products/products/:id` - Update product (Staff/Admin + ownership)
- `PATCH /apis/products/products/:id` - Update product image (Staff/Admin + ownership)
- `DELETE /apis/products/products/:id` - Delete product (Staff/Admin + ownership)

**Products Public API:**

- `GET /apis/pub/products/products` - Paginated products with search and filters
- `GET /apis/pub/products/products/:id` - Get single product
- `GET /apis/pub/products/categories` - List all categories

**Rentals Management:**

- `GET /apis/rentals/types` - List all rental types (Auth)
- `POST /apis/rentals/types` - Create type (Admin only)
- `PUT /apis/rentals/types/:id` - Update type (Admin only)
- `DELETE /apis/rentals/types/:id` - Delete type (Admin only)
- `GET /apis/rentals/transportations` - List all transportations (Auth)
- `POST /apis/rentals/transportations` - Create transportation (Staff/Admin)
- `PUT /apis/rentals/transportations/:id` - Update transportation (Staff/Admin + ownership)
- `PATCH /apis/rentals/transportations/:id` - Update transportation image (Staff/Admin + ownership)
- `DELETE /apis/rentals/transportations/:id` - Delete transportation (Staff/Admin + ownership)

**Rentals Public API:**

- `GET /apis/pub/rentals/transportations` - Paginated transportations with search and filters
- `GET /apis/pub/rentals/transportations/:id` - Get single transportation
- `GET /apis/pub/rentals/types` - List all types

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

**✅ Consistent Architecture:**

- Both features follow the exact same pattern as existing features (blog, news, movies, careers)
- Standardized query parameters: `q` (search), `i` (second entity filter), `limit`, `page`, `sort`
- Consistent error handling without redundant try-catch blocks [[memory:1028511]]
- Clean naming without "Impl" suffix, interfaces with "I" prefix [[memory:1028511]]

**✅ Comprehensive Feature Set:**

- Complete CRUD operations for both entity relationships
- Role-based access control matching project standards
- Image upload capabilities with Cloudinary integration
- Public consumption APIs with pagination and filtering

**✅ Type Safety & Validation:**

- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types
- Zod validation schemas for all input/output
- Proper null handling for associations (category | null, author | null)

**✅ Business Logic:**

- Strategic database constraint error handling
- Ownership verification for updates/deletes
- Foreign key validation before creation/updates

### Cons

**⚠️ Model Complexity:**

- Products feature uses more complex pricing and stock management
- Rentals feature includes location-based filtering which may need geo-search later

**⚠️ Potential Performance:**

- Two additional feature sets increase application startup time
- More routes to process during request routing

## Potential Bugs and Fixes

**Database Relationships:**

- Ensure proper foreign key constraints are set up in migrations
- **Fix**: Verify migration scripts include proper REFERENCES and CASCADE rules

**Image Upload Cleanup:**

- Old images might not be cleaned up when updating product/transportation images
- **Fix**: Implement Cloudinary cleanup in update image operations:
  ```typescript
  // Before updating, delete old image if exists
  if (existingRecord.imgUrl) {
    await CloudinaryHelper.deleteImage(existingRecord.imgUrl);
  }
  ```

**Query Performance:**

- Complex joins with user and category/type data might be slow on large datasets
- **Fix**: Add proper database indexes for frequently queried fields:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_name ON "Branded_Products"("name", "category_id");
  CREATE INDEX idx_transportations_type_name ON "Rental_Transportations"("name", "type_id");
  ```

**Memory Usage:**

- Multiple repositories and services instantiated per request
- **Fix**: Consider implementing dependency injection container for better memory management

## Implementation Notes

- Both features maintain the standardized query parameter pattern established in the project
- Error handling follows the memory guidelines - no redundant try-catch blocks [[memory:1028511]]
- Features are ready for immediate use with seed data from existing JSON files
- All endpoints properly integrated into route mapping system
- Authorization middleware correctly applied based on role requirements
