# Movies Feature Implementation

## Changes Made

### Core Implementation Files Created

**Created `src/features/movies/movie.types.ts`**

- Added comprehensive TypeScript types, DTOs, and validation schemas for movies and genres
- Implemented Zod schemas for CRUD operations and query parameters
- Followed standard public API query pattern: `q` (search), `i` (genre names), `limit`, `page`, `sort`
- Created interfaces for repositories and services following established patterns

**Created `src/features/movies/movie.repository.ts`**

- Implemented `MovieGenreRepository` and `MovieRepository` classes
- Added full CRUD operations with proper Sequelize associations
- Implemented public API pagination with genre name filtering (`i` parameter)
- Added proper null/undefined handling and response mapping
- Applied clean code patterns without redundant try-catch blocks

**Created `src/features/movies/movie.service.ts`**

- Implemented `MovieGenreService` and `MovieService` business logic layers
- Added proper error handling for database constraints (unique violations, foreign key constraints)
- Included genre validation when creating/updating movies
- Followed the established service pattern without unnecessary error wrapping

**Created `src/features/movies/movie.controller.ts`**

- Implemented `MovieGenreController`, `MovieController`, and `MoviePublicController`
- Added comprehensive HTTP request handlers for all CRUD operations
- Included Cloudinary image upload functionality for movie posters
- Applied proper validation using Zod schemas and ResponseDTO patterns

**Created `src/features/movies/movie.routes.ts`**

- Configured authenticated and public route mappings
- Applied proper authentication and authorization middleware
- Implemented ownership controls for movie management
- Added file upload middleware for image handling

### Integration Updates

**Updated `src/app.ts`**

- Imported and registered MovieRoutes for `/apis/movies` and `/apis/pub/movies`
- Added movie routes configuration following established pattern

**Updated `src/shared/utils/route-mapper.ts`**

- Added movie endpoint pattern recognition for route mapping
- Included authentication detection for private movie endpoints
- Enhanced route discovery and documentation generation

**Updated `src/app.service.ts`**

- Added movie endpoints to application info response
- Included both authenticated and public movie API paths

### Postman Collection Enhancement

**Updated `docs/postman.json`**

- Added comprehensive "Movie Management" section with nested organization:
  - **Genres**: CRUD operations for movie genres (Admin only)
  - **Movies**: Full movie management with image upload (Staff/Admin)
  - **Public Movie API**: Public endpoints with pagination and filtering
- Implemented real-world examples with "Blade Runner 2049" movie data
- Added proper authentication, content types, and parameter descriptions
- Followed user's preferred organization structure with descriptions at end

## Technical Architecture

### Query Parameters Standard

- **q**: Search in movie titles (primary search)
- **i**: Filter by genre names (second entity) - comma-separated
- **limit**: Items per page (4-12, default: 10)
- **page**: Page number (min: 1, default: 1)
- **sort**: Sort order (ASC/DESC, default: DESC)

### Security Model

- **Admin**: Full access to genres and all movies
- **Staff**: Can manage movies they created, view genres
- **User**: Authenticated access to view endpoints
- **Public**: Access to movie listings and genre information

### Features Implemented

- **Genre Management**: CRUD operations with unique constraints
- **Movie Management**: Full lifecycle with genre associations, ratings (1-10), synopsis, trailer URLs
- **Image Upload**: Cloudinary integration for movie poster management
- **Public API**: Paginated listings with search and genre filtering
- **Ownership Control**: Staff can only modify movies they created (Admin override available)

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Consistency**: Follows established blog/careers patterns for maintainability
- **Standard Compliance**: Implements the standardized public API query parameter pattern
- **Comprehensive**: Full-featured movie management system with all CRUD operations
- **Scalable**: Proper pagination and filtering for large movie catalogs
- **Secure**: Role-based access control with ownership validation
- **Well-Documented**: Complete Postman collection with real-world examples
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with repository-service-controller pattern

### Cons

- **Database Dependencies**: Requires MovieGenre and Movie tables to be properly migrated
- **File Storage**: Depends on Cloudinary configuration for image uploads
- **Complexity**: Adds another full feature set increasing overall system complexity
- **Migration Requirements**: Needs existing Movie/MovieGenre models to be properly initialized

## Potential Issues

1. **Model Associations**: Ensure Movie and MovieGenre models in `movie.model.ts` have proper `associate()` method calls in the database initialization
2. **Route Conflicts**: Verify no conflicts with existing routes, especially the `/movies` path pattern
3. **Authorization Middleware**: Confirm `requireOwnership(Movie)` middleware works correctly with the Movie model
4. **Public Endpoint Performance**: Large movie catalogs may need additional database indexes for optimal query performance

## Quick Fix Guide

If routes don't work:

1. Check that Movie and MovieGenre models are properly imported in database models index
2. Verify associations are called during database initialization
3. Ensure environment variables for Cloudinary are configured for image uploads

If queries are slow:

1. Add database indexes on frequently queried fields (genre_id, title, rating, created_at)
2. Consider implementing Redis caching for public endpoints
