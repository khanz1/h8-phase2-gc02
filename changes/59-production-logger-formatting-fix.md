# Production Logger Formatting Fix

## What Changed

- **Fixed production logger output format**: Updated the logger configuration to use `pino-pretty` in production environments instead of raw JSON output
- **Added consistent formatting**: Production logs now display in the same readable, colored format as development logs
- **Maintained file logging capability**: When `LOG_FILE=true`, logs are still written to files in JSON format while console output uses pretty formatting

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `src/config/logger.ts`: Updated production logger configuration

### Changes Made

1. **Production with file logging**: Added `pino-pretty` transport for console output while keeping JSON format for file logs
2. **Production without file logging**: Replaced simple formatters with `pino-pretty` transport for consistent formatting
3. **Configuration options**: Added `colorize: true`, `ignore: "pid,hostname"`, `translateTime: "SYS:yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:ss"`, and `messageFormat: "{msg}"` for better readability

### Before vs After

**Before (JSON objects):**

```json
{
  "level": 30,
  "time": "2025-07-02T05:26:54.885Z",
  "pid": 18,
  "hostname": "6b6f7f93eb3a",
  "msg": "üöÄ Server is running on port 8002"
}
```

**After (Formatted):**

```
[2025-07-02 05:26:54] INFO: üöÄ Server is running on port 8002
```

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- ‚úÖ Consistent log format between development and production
- ‚úÖ Better readability in production console output
- ‚úÖ Colored output for easier log level identification
- ‚úÖ Maintains JSON format for file logging when needed
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Cons

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly increased bundle size due to `pino-pretty` in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor performance overhead from pretty formatting (negligible for most applications)

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: pino-pretty not available in production

**Solution**: `pino-pretty` is already in main dependencies, so it's available in production builds.

### Issue 2: Performance impact

**Solution**: The performance impact is minimal. If needed, you can set `LOG_FILE=true` to use JSON format for file logging while keeping pretty console output.

### Issue 3: Docker container logs

**Solution**: The formatted logs will work correctly in Docker containers and can be viewed with `docker logs` command.
