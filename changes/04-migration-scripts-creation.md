# Migration Scripts Implementation

## Files Created/Updated

### Created Files

- `scripts/migrations-undo.sql` - Undo migration script to reverse all database operations
- `scripts/migration-runner.ts` - TypeScript runner for executing migration and undo scripts

### Updated Files

- `package.json` - Added @types/pg as dev dependency

## Implementation Summary

- Created comprehensive undo migration script that reverses all operations from migrations.sql
- Built TypeScript migration runner with proper error handling and logging
- Added support for multiple commands: migrate, rollback, reset, and connection check
- Implemented proper dependency management with @types/pg for TypeScript support

## Technical Details

### Migration Undo Script (`migrations-undo.sql`)

- Drops all triggers in reverse order to prevent conflicts
- Removes trigger function `update_updated_at_column()`
- Drops foreign key constraints before table removal
- Removes all performance indexes
- Drops tables in reverse dependency order to avoid constraint violations
- Cleans up sequences automatically created by PostgreSQL

### Migration Runner (`migration-runner.ts`)

- **Class-based Architecture**: `MigrationRunner` class with dependency injection
- **Database Configuration**: Environment-based config with validation
- **Connection Management**: Proper connect/disconnect lifecycle
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with detailed logging
- **Command Support**:
  - `migrate`: Execute migrations.sql
  - `rollback`: Execute migrations-undo.sql
  - `reset`: Rollback then migrate (complete database reset)
  - `check`: Test database connection
- **Logging Integration**: Uses existing logger configuration
- **File Management**: Validates SQL file existence and content

### Usage Commands

```bash
# Run migrations
npx ts-node scripts/migration-runner.ts migrate

# Rollback migrations
npx ts-node scripts/migration-runner.ts rollback

# Complete database reset
npx ts-node scripts/migration-runner.ts reset

# Test database connection
npx ts-node scripts/migration-runner.ts check
```

### Environment Requirements

The runner requires these environment variables:

- `DB_HOST`: Database host
- `DB_PORT`: Database port
- `DB_NAME`: Database name
- `DB_USERNAME`: Database username
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password

### Features

- **Safe Operations**: Uses `IF EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Logs execution duration for each operation
- **Atomic Operations**: Each command runs in a single connection session
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Extensible**: Can be imported and used programmatically
