# Rooms Feature Implementation

## What Changed

### Files Created

- `src/features/rooms/room.types.ts` - Type definitions, validation schemas, DTOs, and interfaces for room feature
- `src/features/rooms/room.repository.ts` - Data access layer for room types and lodgings
- `src/features/rooms/room.service.ts` - Business logic layer for room operations
- `src/features/rooms/room.controller.ts` - HTTP request handlers for room endpoints
- `src/features/rooms/room.routes.ts` - Route definitions for authenticated and public room endpoints

### Files Updated

- `docs/postman.json` - Added comprehensive Room Management section with all CRUD operations and public endpoints

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Pattern

Following the exact same pattern as products and restaurants features:

- **Room Types** - Accommodation categories (Hotel, Apartment, Resort, etc.)
- **Room Lodgings** - Individual properties with facilities, capacity, and location details
- **Ownership-based Authorization** - Staff/Admin can create, owners can manage their own content
- **Public API** - Paginated browsing with search and filtering capabilities

### Core Features

#### Room Type Management (Admin Only)

- ✅ CRUD operations for accommodation types
- ✅ Unique name constraints
- ✅ Foreign key protection (prevent deletion with associated lodgings)

#### Room Lodging Management

- ✅ Complete CRUD operations with ownership validation
- ✅ Rich property details (name, facility, roomCapacity, location, imgUrl)
- ✅ Cloudinary image upload integration
- ✅ Staff/Admin can create, owners can manage their own
- ✅ Category relationship validation

#### Public API Features

- ✅ Paginated lodging browsing (4-12 items per page)
- ✅ Search by lodging name (`q` parameter)
- ✅ Filter by accommodation type (`i` parameter)
- ✅ Customizable sorting (ASC/DESC by creation date)
- ✅ Public type listing for filter options
- ✅ Detailed lodging view with author and type information

### Security & Validation

- ✅ Comprehensive Zod validation schemas
- ✅ Authentication required for management endpoints
- ✅ Role-based authorization (Admin/Staff for creation, ownership for updates)
- ✅ Input sanitization and error handling
- ✅ Structured error responses

### Database Schema Compliance

- ✅ Uses existing `RoomType` and `RoomLodging` models from room.model.ts
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships (typeId → RoomType, authorId → User)
- ✅ Field mapping matches database schema exactly
- ✅ Supports all migration-defined constraints

### API Endpoints

#### Authenticated Routes (`/apis/rooms/`)

- `GET /types` - List all room types
- `GET /types/:id` - Get type with lodgings
- `POST /types` - Create type (Admin only)
- `PUT /types/:id` - Update type (Admin only)
- `DELETE /types/:id` - Delete type (Admin only)
- `GET /lodgings` - List all lodgings
- `GET /lodgings/:id` - Get specific lodging
- `POST /lodgings` - Create lodging (Admin/Staff)
- `PUT /lodgings/:id` - Update lodging (Admin/Staff/Owner)
- `PATCH /lodgings/:id` - Update lodging image (Admin/Staff/Owner)
- `DELETE /lodgings/:id` - Delete lodging (Admin/Staff/Owner)

#### Public Routes (`/apis/pub/rooms/`)

- `GET /lodgings` - Browse lodgings (paginated, searchable)
- `GET /lodgings/:id` - View lodging details
- `GET /types` - List all types for filtering

### Postman Collection Updates

- ✅ Complete Room Management section with 16 endpoints
- ✅ Organized into Types, Lodgings, and Public API subsections
- ✅ Sample request bodies with realistic accommodation data
- ✅ Query parameter documentation for public endpoints
- ✅ Proper authentication configuration
- ✅ Variable usage for dynamic testing

## Pros

1. **Consistency** - Identical pattern to existing features ensures maintainability
2. **Complete Feature Set** - Full CRUD operations with public consumption APIs
3. **Proper Authorization** - Role-based access with ownership validation
4. **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation
5. **Image Support** - Cloudinary integration for lodging photos
6. **Search & Filter** - Rich querying capabilities for public consumption
7. **Documentation** - Complete Postman collection for testing and integration
8. **Error Handling** - Structured error responses with route wrapper integration
9. **Database Compliance** - Uses existing models without modifications
10. **Scalable Architecture** - Repository/Service pattern supports future enhancements

## Cons

1. **Feature Complexity** - More complex than simple CRUD due to dual entity management
2. **Authorization Logic** - Ownership middleware adds complexity to route definitions
3. **Image Dependency** - Requires Cloudinary configuration for full functionality
4. **Query Complexity** - Public API filtering requires careful parameter validation

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### No Known Critical Issues

The implementation follows the established patterns exactly and uses existing infrastructure.

### Minor Considerations

1. **Image Upload Size** - Consider adding file size limits in upload middleware
2. **Search Performance** - May need database indexing for large datasets
3. **Rate Limiting** - Public endpoints should have appropriate rate limiting

### Validation Notes

- All required fields are properly validated
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate type names
- File upload validation handled by existing middleware

## Testing Guide

1. **Authentication** - Use admin/staff tokens for management operations
2. **Ownership Testing** - Create lodgings with different users, verify ownership rules
3. **Public API Testing** - Test pagination, search, and filtering without authentication
4. **Image Upload** - Test PATCH endpoints with various image formats
5. **Error Scenarios** - Test invalid IDs, unauthorized access, validation failures
