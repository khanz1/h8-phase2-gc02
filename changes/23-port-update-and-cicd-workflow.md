# Port Update and CI/CD Workflow Implementation

## Summary

Updated the application port from 3000 to 8001 to avoid conflicts with other services, and implemented a comprehensive CI/CD workflow for automated deployment to AWS EC2 using GitHub Actions and Docker Hub.

## Files Updated

### Port Configuration Updates

- `Dockerfile` - Updated to use port 8001 (user modified)
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` - Updated development environment port mapping
- `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Updated production environment port mapping
- `docker/nginx/default.conf` - Updated upstream server port
- `docker/docker-test.sh` - Updated port availability check
- `docker/README.md` - Updated documentation with new port references
- `env.example` - Updated default port and CORS origin

### CI/CD Implementation Files

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- `scripts/deploy-setup.sh` - Deployment setup and verification script
- `package.json` - Added deployment setup npm script

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Port Configuration Update

**Application Port Change:**

- Changed from port 3000 to port 8001
- Updated all Docker configurations and health checks
- Modified CORS origins and service discovery
- Updated documentation and examples

**Configuration Files Updated:**

- Docker Compose development configuration
- Docker Compose production configuration
- Nginx reverse proxy upstream configuration
- Environment variable examples
- Health check endpoints
- Documentation references

### 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow

**Workflow Triggers:**

- Triggered on push to `production` branch
- Runs on Ubuntu 24.04 runner
- Uses Node.js 22.x for compatibility

**Build Process:**

- Checkout code from repository
- Set up Node.js environment
- Install dependencies with `npm ci`
- Run TypeScript type checking
- Run ESLint for code quality
- Verify deployment setup script
- Build and push Docker image to Docker Hub

**Deployment Process:**

- SSH into AWS EC2 instance
- Create application directory and environment file
- Pull latest Docker image from registry
- Stop and remove existing containers gracefully
- Start PostgreSQL database if not running
- Deploy application container with proper networking
- Run database migrations automatically
- Perform health checks and verification
- Clean up old Docker images

### 3. Docker Hub Integration

**Image Management:**

- Builds production-optimized Docker image
- Tags with both `latest` and commit SHA
- Pushes to Docker Hub registry
- Uses multi-stage build for optimization
- Implements proper caching strategies

**Registry Configuration:**

- Repository: `{username}/phase2-graded-challenge`
- Tags: `latest` and `{git-sha}`
- Production target build
- Automated push on successful build

### 4. AWS EC2 Deployment

**Container Orchestration:**

- PostgreSQL database container
- Application container with proper linking
- Volume mounts for data persistence
- Network configuration for service communication
- Restart policies for reliability

**Environment Management:**

- Environment file creation from GitHub secrets
- Port configuration (8001)
- Database connection setup
- Security configuration
- Logging and monitoring setup

**Health Monitoring:**

- Application health endpoint verification
- Container status monitoring
- Log collection and analysis
- Automated restart on failure
- Resource cleanup and optimization

### 5. Deployment Setup Script

**Pre-deployment Verification:**

- Project structure validation
- Required file existence checks
- TypeScript compilation verification
- Docker build testing
- Environment configuration validation

**Documentation Generation:**

- Creates comprehensive deployment guide
- Lists required GitHub secrets
- Provides manual deployment commands
- Includes troubleshooting information
- Documents environment variables

### 6. Security Implementation

**Container Security:**

- Non-root user execution
- Secure environment variable handling
- Network isolation and linking
- Resource limits and constraints
- Minimal attack surface

**Deployment Security:**

- SSH key-based authentication
- Encrypted environment variables
- Secret management through GitHub
- Database password protection
- SSL/TLS ready configuration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Port Migration Strategy

- Systematic update of all port references
- Maintained backward compatibility in documentation
- Updated health check endpoints
- Modified service discovery configuration
- Ensured consistent port usage across all environments

### CI/CD Pipeline Design

- Fail-fast approach with early validation
- Parallel execution where possible
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging and monitoring
- Rollback capability preparation

### Container Orchestration

- Proper dependency management between services
- Health check implementation
- Volume persistence for data
- Network configuration for communication
- Resource optimization and limits

### Environment Configuration

- Separation of development and production settings
- Secure secret management
- Environment variable validation
- Configuration flexibility
- Default value handling

## Required GitHub Secrets

### Docker Hub Integration

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token

### AWS EC2 Configuration

- `EC2_HOST`: EC2 instance IP or hostname
- `EC2_USER`: SSH username (ubuntu/ec2-user)
- `EC2_SSH_KEY`: Private SSH key for access

### Application Environment

- `DB_PASSWORD`: Production database password
- `PROD_ENV_FILE`: Complete production environment configuration

## Usage Instructions

### Development Environment

```bash
# Start development environment (now on port 8001)
npm run docker:dev

# Access application: http://localhost:8001
# Health check: http://localhost:8001/health
```

### Deployment Setup

```bash
# Verify deployment readiness
npm run deploy:setup

# Check Docker configuration
npm run docker:test
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Automatic deployment (push to production branch)
git push origin production

# Manual deployment verification
curl -f http://your-ec2-host:8001/health
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Port Conflict Resolution**: Application now runs on port 8001, avoiding conflicts with other services on port 8000
2. **Automated Deployment**: Complete CI/CD pipeline from code push to production deployment
3. **Production Readiness**: Full production environment with proper security and monitoring
4. **Scalability**: Container-based deployment ready for horizontal scaling
5. **Reliability**: Health checks, restart policies, and error handling
6. **Security**: Encrypted secrets, SSH authentication, and secure container execution
7. **Maintainability**: Comprehensive documentation and setup verification
8. **Monitoring**: Health checks, logging, and container status monitoring

## Deployment Process

1. **Code Changes**: Push to `production` branch
2. **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing and building
3. **Image Creation**: Docker image build and push
4. **Deployment**: Automated EC2 deployment
5. **Migration**: Database migration execution
6. **Verification**: Health check and status verification
7. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and logging
