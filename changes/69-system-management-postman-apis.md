# System Management APIs - Postman Collection Update

## Changes Summary

### What Changed

- Added new "System Management" section to Postman collection
- Added system-level API endpoints from app.ts and app.service.ts
- Enhanced application info endpoint to include careers and seed endpoints
- Added SEED_CODE environment variable for secure database operations

### Files Modified

#### Postman Collection

- **docs/postman.json**:
  - Added new "System Management" section after Authentication
  - Added 5 new endpoint requests with comprehensive documentation
  - Added SEED_CODE variable to environment variables

#### Application Service

- **src/app.service.ts**: Updated app info endpoint to include careers and seed endpoints

### New Endpoints Added

#### System Management Section

1. **Health Check** (`GET /health`)

   - Public endpoint for application health monitoring
   - Returns status, timestamp, uptime, environment, version
   - No authentication required

2. **Application Info** (`GET /`)

   - Public endpoint for general application information
   - Returns name, version, description, available endpoints
   - No authentication required

3. **Database Seed** (`GET /apis/seed?code={{SEED_CODE}}&type=seed`)

   - Populate database with initial data
   - Requires secret seed code for security
   - Default operation type

4. **Database Re-seed** (`GET /apis/seed?code={{SEED_CODE}}&type=re-seed`)

   - Clear existing data and repopulate with fresh seed data
   - Destructive operation with clear warnings
   - Requires secret seed code

5. **Empty Database** (`GET /apis/seed?code={{SEED_CODE}}&type=empty`)
   - Remove all data from database tables
   - Most destructive operation with extreme caution warnings
   - Requires secret seed code

## Technical Details

### Security Implementation

- **SEED_CODE Variable**: Added to Postman environment for secure operations
- **Query Parameters**: Comprehensive descriptions for code and type parameters
- **Operation Types**: Clear documentation of seed, re-seed, and empty operations

### Response Structure

- **Health Check**: Returns structured health data with uptime and environment info
- **App Info**: Returns comprehensive application metadata and endpoint listing
- **Seed Operations**: Returns operation status, duration, and affected records

### Documentation Quality

- **Comprehensive Descriptions**: Each endpoint has detailed explanation of purpose and usage
- **Parameter Documentation**: All query parameters include descriptions and validation rules
- **Security Warnings**: Appropriate warnings for destructive operations
- **Public Access**: Clear indication of endpoints that don't require authentication

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

✅ **Complete API Coverage**: All system endpoints now documented in Postman  
✅ **Developer Experience**: Easy testing of health checks and system operations  
✅ **Security Awareness**: Clear documentation of authentication requirements  
✅ **Operational Clarity**: Well-documented seed operations with safety warnings  
✅ **Environment Management**: SEED_CODE variable for secure operations

### Cons

❌ **Security Risk**: Seed operations could be misused if code is compromised  
❌ **Complexity**: Additional endpoints to maintain and document

## Benefits

- **Monitoring**: Easy health check testing for DevOps and monitoring systems
- **Development**: Quick access to database seeding operations during development
- **Documentation**: Complete API reference for all available system endpoints
- **Security**: Proper documentation of security requirements and operation impacts

## Usage Guidelines

- **Health Check**: Use for monitoring and uptime verification
- **App Info**: Use for API discovery and version checking
- **Seed Operations**: Use only in development/staging environments
- **SEED_CODE**: Keep secret and never commit to version control
