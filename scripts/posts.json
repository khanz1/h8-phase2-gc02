While it manages most operations via a single thread, it also employs the libuv library, which uses an event demultiplexer and a thread pool for certain operations (like file I/O or DNS queries) that can''t be handled asynchronously. This allows Node.js to maximize resource utilization and handle multiple client requests concurrently.','https://res.cloudinary.com/dpjqm8kkk/image/upload/v1723522657/hacktiv8/blog/node.js-is-not-single-threaded-jhqkqg503bj.jpg',1,5),(DEFAULT,'2025-06-25 09:02:24.013 +00:00','2025-06-25 09:02:24.013 +00:00','I''m tired of it','AI-generated content is pervasive, often creating bland, inaccurate articles that lack true value.
